These contracts are part of a larger group of financial<br/>instruments called derivatives. On Robinhood, options contracts are traded on<br/>stocks   and ETFs.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Generally speaking, options are quite flexible, and they can be used in different<br/>ways depending on a person’s goals. Some people use options to hedge the risk<br/>of losses (for instance, helping protect the value of their portfolio from a<br/>downturn). Others may use options to pursue additional income by monetizing<br/>the stocks they own. However, it’s important to note that trading options is<br/>generally riskier than investing in stocks. When trading options, potential losses<br/>can accrue at a much faster rate, and it’s possible to lose your entire initial<br/>investment (or more). Trading options requires approval on Robinhood, and it<br/>isn’t appropriate for everyone.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Want to learn more before diving in? Our Options Knowledge Center helps<br/>explain key terminology, </span><span class="s2">basic</span> and <span class="s2">advanced</span> <span>trading strategies, and how to place<br/>an options trade on Robinhood.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Options Versus Stocks</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Options are a way to actively interact with stocks you’re interested in without<br/>actually trading the stocks themselves. When you trade options, you can control<br/>shares of stock without ever having to own them.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Leverage</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With options, an investor can magnify their potential gains or losses, relative to<br/>their initial investment. This is known as leverage. When a person buys an option,<br/>they gain exposure to the movement of a stock, and that contract represents a<br/>potential trade of 100 shares (that is, without the investor necessarily owning the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>underlying shares at any point in time). As a result, even small changes in a stock<br/>price—up or down—can have a dramatic effect on the value of an options<br/>position. Leverage can provide the opportunity for outsized gains, while exposing<br/>an investor to outsized losses. Leverage is part of what makes options strategies<br/>risky.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Ask Price</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>The ask price is the amount of money sellers in the market are willing to receive<br/>for an options contract. The ask price will always be higher than the bid price.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Bid Price</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>The bid price is the amount of money buyers in the market are willing to pay for<br/>an options contract. The bid price will always be lower than the ask price.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Strike Price</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>The strike price of an options contract is the price at which the options contract<br/>can be exercised.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Think of the strike price as the anchor of your contract: If you’re buying a call,<br/>your call is profitable if the value of the stock goes above the strike price (plus<br/>whatever premium you paid). If the value of the stock stays below your strike<br/>price, your options contract will expire worthless. Remember, you’re not actually<br/>buying shares of the stock unless you exercise your contract. This is because the<br/>contract gives you the option to buy the actual shares of the stock at the strike<br/>price.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buying and Selling an Options Contract</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Options can be tricky, so it’s important to know exactly how the actions you take<br/>will get you closer to your goal:</span></p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><b>Buying to open </b><span>an options position means that you’re purchasing the<br/>contract.

The owner of<br/>the contract is likely to exercise the contract if it’s “in the money.” On the other<br/>hand, the person who sold the contract to collect the premium is assigned when<br/>the owner of the contract exercises it.</span></p><p class="s2" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span class="p">For more information on exercise and assignment, check out our article </span>Exercise,<span class="s3"><br/></span>Assignment, &amp; Expiration<span class="p">.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Premium</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Since the owner has the right to either exercise the contract or let it simply expire<br/>worthless, she pays the premium–the per-share cost for holding the contract–to<br/>the seller. As a buyer, you can think of the premium as the price to purchase the<br/>option. If you buy or sell an option before expiration, the premium is the price it<br/>trades for. You can trade the option in the market similar to how you’d trade a<br/>stock. The premium is not arbitrary, as it’s tied to the value of the contract and<br/>the underlying security. The underlying stock’s price, the underlying stock’s<br/>volatility, and the amount of time left until expiration all influence an option’s<br/>premium.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Liquidity</h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Liquidity refers to the ability for a trader to open or close an option position at a<br/>given price and time. This is based on supply and demand in the marketplace.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Low liquidity can hinder or prevent a trader from being able to buy or sell a<br/>contract. For instance, if there isn’t a buyer interested in purchasing an options<br/>contract you’d like to sell at a specific price, you may not be able to sell the<br/>contract when you’d like to, which can affect your potential gains or losses.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Call Options</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Owners of call options generally expect the stock to increase in value, while<br/>sellers of call options generally expect the stock’s value to decrease or remain the<br/>same.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Buying a call option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares<br/>of the underlying stock at the designated strike price.

Like<br/>stocks, you can make or lose money on the options you trade as prices change.<br/>But that’s where the similarities begin and end. Options have many nuances<br/>which we’ll cover both here and in other articles. Not to mention, for any one<br/>particular stock there could be thousands of different options. &quot;Why,&quot; you ask?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, there are two kinds of options—“call” and “put” contracts. <i>Calls </i><span>(aka call<br/>options) lock in a price to buy stock. </span><i>Puts </i><span>(aka put options) lock in a selling price.<br/>Calls and puts move in opposite directions, kind of like traffic on a two-way<br/>street. You can buy calls when you think the stock will go up, or buy puts when<br/>you think it’ll go down.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Just like the milk in your fridge, options expire. Some expire in a day or a week,<br/>while others expire in a month, many months, or even years. But, option<br/>contracts </span><i>don’t have to be held all the way to expiration</i><span>. In fact, most options<br/>traders close their position before it reaches its expiration date.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Look at these option chains of calls (left) and puts (right) of the hypothetical<br/>company, Tiger, Inc. (Stock symbol MEOW).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>It’s important to know that there are many “strike prices.” Since options are<br/>contracts, “call strikes” lock in a buy-price of the stock and “put strikes” lock-in<br/>the sell-price of a stock. There are many strikes above and below the price of the<br/>underlying stock—the further away from the stock price, the more expensive or<br/>cheaper the options get depending on whether they are “in the money” or “out<br/>of  the money.”</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The “in, at, and out of money” options</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Even though there are a ton of different strikes, you’ll hear traders referring to<br/>three groups: “in the money” (ITM), “at the money” (ATM), and “out of the<br/>money” (OTM) options.</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the money: <span class="p">options with strike prices that would give you the right to trade<br/>the stock at a better price than the current price of the stock.</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>For calls, it’s the options with strike prices that are lower than the stock<br/>price.</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 18pt;text-align: left;"><span>For puts, it’s options with strike prices that are higher than the stock price.<br/></span><b>At the money: </b><span>options with a strike price that’s either right at (or very close to)<br/>the stock price.

What’s<br/>important to note is the difference in which their prices change as the stock<br/>moves. The very deep ITM options (calls with very low strike prices, or puts with<br/>very high strike prices) may change nearly dollar-for-dollar with the stock. The<br/>super far OTM options (calls with very high strike prices, or puts with very low<br/>strike prices) will move slowly (if even at all). The rest of the options will change<br/>price on a continuum between the two extremes (think of a slope that is<br/>gradually changing), with the ATM options changing price at about 50% of the<br/>change in the stock price.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Even though option prices don’t change as quickly as the stock does in dollar<br/>terms, the percentage change in an option’s price can be huge. But option prices</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>can also go to zero, whereas that’s tough to do with the stock of a major<br/>company (although, it can happen, too).</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why consider buying calls?</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Because you think the stock that it’s attached to (the “underlying” stock) is going<br/>up. Period.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Here’s an example (stay with us—we’ll explain each piece). Let’s go back to our<br/>theoretical company, Tiger, Inc. Its stock (ticker symbol MEOW) is trading at $128,<br/>and you pay $2 to buy one MEOW </span><b>January 29th </b><i>140 call option</i>. <b>January 29th</b>, and <i>140 is the strike price</i><span>. The $2 price you paid is called<br/>the “premium” and it’s the price per share. Since each option controls 100 shares<br/>of stock, your cost to buy this call is actually $200. Compare that to shelling out</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">$12,800 to actually buying 100 shares of MEOW.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Why would you buy a call option that gives you the right to lock in a buying price<br/>that’s $12 </span><i>higher </i><span>than the current price $128? Because there’s a chance it could<br/>get there </span><i>before </i><span>expiration. As an options trader, you don’t really care if it does<br/>get there, but the price of the option reflects that probability. If there’s a chance<br/>that the stock could be </span><i>above </i><span>the strike price at expiration, then the option will<br/>have value. That probability increases when the stock goes up, which is what<br/>drives the option price higher. And that’s how profits are made— you don’t need<br/>the stock to reach the strike price in order to have a profitable trade, but it<br/>certainly helps.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>But here’s the rub: even if MEOW goes higher, it might not be enough to profit<br/>because it took too long to get there. The key here? Time. </span><i>Time is also a</i></p><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">factor <span class="p">and is the arch nemesis of long options traders because time erodes<br/>options premiums. Let’s say that again: </span>time erodes options premiums<span class="p">. If MEOW is<br/>below $140 at expiration, the option goes poof— and it ain’t worth a penny. At</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>$142, you breakeven. But again, you do not need, nor likely want, to hold the<br/>option that long, since the stock doesn’t need to reach the strike price in order<br/>for you to profit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>On the other hand, assume that MEOW jumps to $150. A call option that has a<br/>strike price that’s lower than the current stock price is said to be “in the money.”<br/>A call with a 140 strike price is worth at least $10 ($1,000 per option). That’s an $8<br/>profit on a $2 trade, which is a 400% return, and it might be smart to close the<br/>trade in this situation.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>But what if you still own this call and it expires in the money (remember, in the<br/>money is when a call option has a strike price that’s lower than the current stock<br/>price)? This is the only time you would be forced to exercise your call to capture<br/>its value, and if you don’t want to be on the hook to buy $14,000 worth of stock<br/>(for each call you own), you need to sell the option before it expires.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">What about puts?</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>“Put options” work very much the same, except in the opposite direction. If you<br/>think a stock is going down, you can buy “puts.” Whereas calls let you lock into a<br/>buy price, buying a put option gives you the right to lock-in a selling price for the<br/>stock. This means that put options usually increase in value when the stock<br/>moves lower.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Buying puts is a less risky way to root for a stock’s tumble than shorting a stock<br/>because you can only lose what you pay for the put, whereas the risk of loss<br/>when shorting stocks is unlimited (remember, shorting stock isn’t actually<br/>allowed on Robinhood).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s go back to the example of MEOW, which is trading at $128. Suppose you<br/>buy the February 19th 120 put for $3.00 because you think MEOW is moving<br/>lower. You’ve got a maximum risk of the $300 you paid for the option. If MEOW<br/>moves lower between now and expiration, the 120 put could increase in price,<br/>and you could sell your put option for a profit. Or, worst case scenario, the<br/>option loses all of its value and you’re out the $300.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">The big three of options pricing</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Despite what it may look like, there is a method behind the madness of option<br/>pricing—it isn’t arbitrary. The good news is that all the heavy math has already<br/>been done for you when you see a price quote. But since we’re here, let’s geek<br/>out a little and break it down a bit.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The three biggest influences on option prices are:</p></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Price <span class="p">- stock price compared to strike price</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Time <span class="p">- number of calendar days until expiration</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: justify;">Implied Volatility <span class="p">– how much the stock is expected to move in a given<br/>timeframe</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>There are others, such as interest rates, and dividends, but they don’t have as<br/>much of a material impact. For now, let’s focus on the big three.</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Stock price vs. strike price: <span class="p">comparing the stock price to the strike price<br/>determines if the option has any “real value.” Real value (also commonly referred</span></h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>to as Intrinsic Value) is the amount that an option is in the money (remember, we<br/>can also shorten this to ITM). If a call option is already $5 ITM, you’re not getting<br/>that for free. That $5 will be baked into the option price and that ITM amount is<br/>called the “real value” of the option. ATM and OTM options don’t have any real<br/>value. All option prices have another component which is the “time value”—<br/>composed of time itself and “implied volatility.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Days until expiration: <span class="p">the more time there is until expiration, the more time<br/>there is for the stock to move. This means there’s more time for the option to<br/>move ITM (or OTM for that matter). The more time, the more expensive the<br/>option. No complex formula on this one—it is that simple. When you look at the<br/>same strike price across expiration periods, you’ll see that options get more<br/>expensive with longer time frames.</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><b>Implied Volatility: </b><span>a big part of expressing the cost of an option’s premium is in<br/>the implied volatility (IV), which is an expression of how much the stock is<br/>expected to move as a percentage. The more a stock is expected to </span><i>move</i>,</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the <i>greater </i><span>the time value component is going to be. This is where “implied<br/>volatility” comes in. An option with low IV will be cheaper than the same option<br/>with high IV. In practical terms, it’s a way of expressing the “relative” cost of an<br/>option.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The clock is always ticking</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Looking at options across all expiration cycles, the lower priced options (relatively<br/>speaking) are those that expire first. Just because something is lower in price<br/>doesn’t necessarily make it better—they’re cheaper for a reason. Based on all the<br/>other inputs of an options price, including volatility, time, and stock price, a<br/>“cheap” OTM option has a low probability of ending up ITM by expiration. This is<br/>in part because a stock’s move higher might not be fast or far enough to offset<br/>something called “time decay,” or the cost of holding an option per day (in trader<br/>geek-speak, this is called </span><i>“theta”</i>).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Time decay can happen slowly (in the case of longer-term options) or very<br/>quickly (short-term options). Let’s take a look at this graph:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Notice that the time decay of a: 90-day option barely registers—the line looks<br/>relatively flat and there’s little change. 60-day option picks up steam and starts to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>have a material impact on the option premium. 30-day option that is headed into<br/>expiration is often greater than the impact of the stock price moving higher.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Add to that a drop in IV (implied volatility), and a lower priced OTM option will<br/>likely get crushed—a numbing frustration to option traders all over. To trade<br/>short-term options, you have a much smaller window of time for the stock to<br/>move higher, whereas, buying longer-term options, you have some breathing<br/>room should the stock stall or take its sweet time moving higher.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>When it comes to options, there’s a lot to unpack. Take your time and get to<br/>know the ins and outs of calls and puts before you jump in. Once you understand<br/>the basics, you can start to grasp and see the bigger picture. Once you’ve<br/>mastered calls and puts, you can then begin to piece different options together<br/>across price, strikes, time, and volatility to accomplish seemingly endless<br/>possibilities to trade up, down, sideways, and dunno markets.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Next up: <span style=" color: #00C805;">Let’s talk about volatility</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Disclosures:</h2><p class="s4" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Any hypothetical examples are provided for illustrative purposes only.

Many<br/>refer   to these as “single” option strategies, because they only require one option.<br/>They are:</span></p><ol id="l5"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Long call</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Long put</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Covered call</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Cash-secured puts</p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Long calls and puts are <i>the </i><span>most basic of all the options strategies, and perhaps<br/>the easiest to execute because, well, they’re generally a lot cheaper than the<br/>stocks they’re attached to (and simpler to understand). Like stocks, you buy a call<br/>or put based on your opinion of the stock’s trend, and then sell them at some<br/>point, hopefully for a profit.

In our example, the<br/>August 100 call, you’d need $10,000 to buy 100 shares. This is why most options<br/>traders simply close the position by selling the option back into the market. And<br/>remember, at this point, the theoretical max loss (the cost of the call option) no<br/>longer holds true. Once you own 100 shares of stock, your risk is the price you<br/>paid for the stock all the way down to 0.

If you recall, </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">shorting something </span><span>means to sell it first, and buy it back<br/>later, hopefully for less than you sold it for. It can be done with stocks (just, not at<br/>Robinhood Financial) or options (yes, at Robinhood Financial, but with<br/>restrictions).  When it’s done with options, you may never have to “buy back” the<br/>option because the aim is for the option to decay to zero on its own and expire<br/>worthless.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>You’ll recall, being “long” (owning) an option contract allows you to either buy<br/>stock (if you exercise a call) or sell stock (by exercising a put) before expiration.<br/>The other side of that trade could be someone who is selling you that call or put<br/>short, which makes them obligated to sell the stock to you (if they’re short the<br/>call) or buy the stock from you (if they’re short the put). The table below breaks it<br/>down:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selling single options</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>With certain “income” strategies, like the covered call and the cash-secured put<br/>(aka cash-covered put), you could sell options first (typically OTM options), which<br/>are “covered” by the stock you own (in a covered call) or the cash you set aside<br/>(in a cash-secured put). In either strategy, you collect the option premium up<br/>front, with the hope the stock doesn’t cross into the money on your strike.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Meanwhile you’re letting time and volatility decay your option to lower prices or<br/>even zero at expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>There are four primary single-option selling strategies that most option traders<br/>learn at some point—short call, short put, covered call, and cash-secured put.<br/>The first two—the short call and put—are known as “naked” strategies because<br/>you’re exposed without a hedge (protection in case something goes awry). Since<br/>Robinhood Financial doesn’t allow naked option selling, we’ll focus on the<br/>covered   call and the cash-secured put (both of which happen to be bullish<br/>strategies).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Both the covered call and cash-secured put allow you to sell (aka short) an<br/>option up front and collect the premium, as long as you own the stock (for a<br/>covered call), or have enough cash in your account (for a cash-secured put) to<br/>buy the stock. The goal is for the option to decrease in value or expire worthless<br/>on or before expiration, without much movement in the stock.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Since the risk profiles of these two strategies are essentially the same, whether<br/>you own the stock or not typically serves as the basis for your decision of which<br/>one to trade.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">NAME: COVERED CALL</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">PROFIT GRAPH:</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">WHY TRADE IT? <span class="p">You think a stock is going up imminently, is going to trend<br/>sideways, or possibly take a small dip in price</span></h2><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OPTIMAL CONDITIONS: <span class="p">Medium to high volatility, bullish to sideways stock<br/></span>SETUP: <span class="p">Long 100 shares of stock + short higher strike call (usually with a short-<br/>term expiration; ~20-45 days to expiration)</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>(On the Robinhood platform, this requires “legging” into the covered call by<br/>buying 100 shares of stock first, then selling the short call.

The Greeks help determine how options may react to a given change in<br/>some of these factors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>There are five primary Greeks (and a handful of minor Greeks). These are the five<br/>primary Greeks:</span></p><h1 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delta</h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta (Δ) represents the sensitivity of an option’s price to changes in the value of<br/>the underlying </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">security</span><span>. In other words, how much does the price of the option<br/>go up or down as the price of the security goes up and down? Delta measures<br/>how much the price of the option will change as a result of a $1 change in the<br/>price of the asset. The Delta of an option varies over the life of that option,<br/>depending on the underlying stock price and the amount of time left until<br/>expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta usually appears as a decimal number. Put options have a negative<br/>relationship with Delta due to a negative relationship with the underlying<br/>security. Premiums are expected to go down as the price of the security goes up.<br/>Therefore, the Delta will range from zero to negative one for put options.</span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Call options<span style=" color: #000;">, on the other hand, have a positive relationship with Delta due to a<br/>positive relationship with the underlying security. Premiums are expected to go<br/>up as the price of the security goes up. Therefore, the Delta will range from zero<br/>to one for call options. For example, if a call option has a Delta of .50, we know<br/>that the price of the option changes by an average of 50 cents when the price of<br/>the security changes by $1.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta also represents an approximation of the probability that an option will be<br/>in-the-money (aka worth money) at the time it expires. An option with a Delta of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>.50 is at the money, meaning it’s neutral. Anything lower probably won’t be in-<br/>the-money, while anything higher probably will be in-the-money. Keep in mind<br/>this is an approximation and does not guarantee that these results will hold true.</span></p><h1 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gamma</h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Gamma (Γ) represents the rate of change of Delta relative to the change of the<br/>price of the underlying security. It measures how much Delta changes if the value<br/>of the security increases or decreases by $1. Investors use Gamma to help<br/>forecast changes in an option’s Delta and determine how stable Delta is. Gamma<br/>will be a number anywhere from 0 to 1.00.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>As an example, let’s go back to our example of the Delta of .50. Let’s say that the<br/>option’s Gamma is .10. So if the price of the security goes up or down by $1, then<br/>the Delta would probably go up or down by .10, all else being equal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Gamma is a helpful tool because the Delta value of an option can change over<br/>time. So if you look at two securities with the same Delta, you don’t necessarily<br/>know which is more likely to stay at the same Delta. Gamma helps to determine<br/>how stable Delta is.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Gamma is higher for options that are at-the-money and closer to expiration. The<br/>higher Gamma is, the more unstable Delta is as the price of the underlying stock<br/>changes. Let’s look again at our example of the option with the Delta of .50.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>We’ve already said the Gamma is .10. That’s pretty stable, and it’s unlikely Delta<br/>will change drastically. But if that same option had a Gamma of .90, it would be<br/>pretty likely that Delta would change dramatically as the price of the underlying<br/>stock changes.</span></p><h1 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Theta</h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>Theta (Θ) represents the rate of time decay of an option. Specifically, it describes<br/>how much the value of an option changes each day as expiration nears. An</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>example of this is that an option with a Theta of -.50 would decrease by an<br/>average of 50 cents every day, all else being equal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Options tend to lose value as the expiration date nears, so Theta is usually a<br/>negative number. As the expiration date nears, Theta is likely to increase because<br/>the time left to earn a </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">profit </span>from the option decreases.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Time decay is good for the seller of an option because as time passes, the<br/>chances increase of the option expiring with no action taken. Likewise, it’s bad for<br/>the buyer of an option because as time passes, the chances decrease of them<br/>making money from their option.</span></p><h1 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Vega</h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Vega (v) represents an option’s sensitivity to volatility. It measures the rate of<br/>change of an option’s value relative to the security’s volatility. More specifically, it<br/>measures how much the price of an option changes based on a 1% change in<br/>the volatility of the underlying security. A decrease in Vega usually represents a<br/>decrease in the value of both put options and call options. An increase in Vega<br/>usually represents an increase in the value of both put options and call options.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Vega is an essential measurement because volatility is one of the more important<br/>factors affecting option values. So all else being equal, it makes sense to<br/>purchase  an option that is less sensitive to volatility, or with a higher Vega.</span></p><h1 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">Rho</h1><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Rho (p) represents how sensitive the price of an option is relative to <span style=" color: #00C805;">interest<br/>rates</span><span>. It measures the rate of change in an option’s value based on a 1% change<br/>in the interest rate (based on the risk-free interest rate, or the rate of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">U.S. <span style=" color: #00C805;">Treasury bills</span><span>). For example, if an option has a Rho of .50, then the value of<br/>the option would increase or decrease by an average of 50 cents when the<br/>interest rate increases or decreases by 1%. Rho is the least significant of the<br/>factors we’ve discussed since the interest rate does not affect the value of an<br/>option as much as other determinants. However, it should be considered if<br/>current interest rates are expected to change.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 32pt;text-align: left;">What are the Minor Greeks?</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho are the Greeks most often discussed in<br/>terms of options-trading, but they aren’t the only ones.

If you buy calls<br/>or puts and decide to do what the option gives you the right to do—buy stock<br/>for call options or sell stock for put options—it sets off a process called “exercise<br/>and assignment.” Normally, this isn’t the road most traders go down. Rather,<br/>most traders open options positions with the intent to close them later for a<br/>profit—un-exercised. Let’s break things down and take a closer look at the<br/>mechanics       of exercise and assignment.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mechanics of exercise &amp; assignment</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>When you exercise a long call, you convert your call into stock. You’ll actually get<br/>100 shares of the stock for every call you exercise…along with a bill for the cost<br/>of the stock, dictated by the strike of the call you’re exercising. For example, if<br/>you exercised a call with a strike price of $50, you would buy 100 shares of the<br/>underlying stock at $50 per share, for a total cost of $5,000.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, your exercise is <i>someone else’s assignment</i><span>. A randomly selected person<br/>who is short that call option receives a notice that they’ve been “assigned” and<br/>are required to sell 100 shares of stock for every option they’re assigned.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>If we’re talking about put options, when you exercise your put, you’re selling<br/>(“putting,” actually) the stock to someone (also nameless) who is short a put on<br/>the other side of the trade.

If you stand to lose more selling<br/>the option than simply exercising, it makes sense to go ahead and exercise.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>You don’t want to sell an option for less than its real value (the value<br/>that’s </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">in the money</span>).</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>Sometimes it is worth exercising your long call to collect a dividend.<br/>Remember, options owners do not take part in collecting dividends, only<br/>stockholders.</span></p></li></ol><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Then, here’s why you may not want to exercise.</p><ol id="l11"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Long options are cheaper than long or short stock.</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>Long options are lower risk in that only the premium spent is the<br/>maximum you can lose when compared to being long or short stock.

If an option is OTM and you don’t want it anymore, you try to sell<br/>it.   If there is no value to it, you may want to just let it expire worthless. Who<br/>knows, the stock could make a comeback before expiration.</span></p></li></ol><h2 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">…and now for the Ugly (of Assignment)</h2><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Where new options traders can get in a lot of trouble is misunderstanding<br/>assignments—particularly when they’re trading spreads, which contain both a<br/>long         and a short option. Whereas exercising is something you control in a long<br/>position, assignment is something that can happen to you at any time while<br/>you’re  in a short position.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>If your short put option goes in the money and you’re assigned, the cash balance<br/>in your account might show a large loss equal to the size of the assigned<br/>position. If your short call option gets assigned, you might see a short stock<br/>position resulting from selling shares you didn’t already own. But fear not! That’s<br/>where your long option comes to the rescue.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>As soon as you exercise the long option from the spread, you’ll immediately<br/>offset the loss, minus the maximum loss of the spread (which is usually the<br/>distance between the short and long strikes of the options).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Closing time, time for you to go out…</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>If you’re speculating with options, exercising is rarely the optimal choice to close<br/>your position. However, it’s worth knowing when you should or shouldn’t and<br/>what to do when faced with the decision.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>If you have a short, deep-in-the-money option and are at risk of being assigned,<br/>it’s usually best to close the position and move on prior to expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Assignment doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s the reason you never want to<br/>“set and forget” about your options trades, particularly spreads with short<br/>options.

It’s usually the first pitfall new traders come<br/>across in their trade selection process. Now, we can’t tell you what stock or<br/>underlying to trade (it’s against the rules), but we can share some information to<br/>help you find one that’s appropriate for you. While we can spend an entire article<br/>on this (and we will), here are some crucial things to consider:</span></p><ol id="l14"><li data-list-text="1."><h2 style="padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: -14pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Trade underlyings with good liquidity <span class="p">No, we’re not talking about</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">water. <i>Liquidity </i><span>is the ease with which you can get in and out of a position. This<br/>can usually be spotted when an underlying stock or ETF has a tight </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">“bid/ask<br/>spread,” </span><span>and at least a million or more shares traded per day (unlike say some<br/>“penny” stock you heard about on an online forum—spidey senses activated).</span></p></li><li data-list-text="2."><h2 style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Trade options with great liquidity <span class="p">If the underlying is more liquid, the<br/>options tend to be as well. Options with good liquidity usually have tight bid/ask<br/>spreads (ie. 1.00 bid x 1.01 ask; 2.25 bid x 2:30 ask; 35.50 bid x 35.80 ask) and<br/>plenty  of volume (contracts traded) and open interest (contracts open).</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">What does an illiquid option’s price look like? .50 bid x 4.25 ask; 1.00 bid x .5.25;</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>.05 bid x 5.00. If an option is 0 bid (zero bid), this means at the moment there are<br/>no willing buyers for this option. So if you see 0.00 bid x 5.00 and you pay 5.00 or<br/>less for that option, you will have no one to turn around and sell it to. You can<br/>get into the position, but you can’t get out unless someone places a bid to buy<br/>the contract. Illiquid options are like the Hotel California: You can check out<br/>anytime you like, but you may never leave.

Because, in<br/>trading, your capital is everything. In fact, it’s the only thing that matters at the<br/>end of the day. If you don’t have capital, you can’t trade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>For the most part, your goal isn’t to win. Your goal is to lose less than you win.<br/>Another way traders phrase this is, “it’s not about how much you make, it’s about<br/>how much you </span><i>don’t </i><span>lose.” Losses are inevitable, so controlling how much you<br/>could lose </span><i>before </i><span>you enter into a trade could be the single most important<br/>decision you make before each trade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Determining how much capital you put into each trade is called “position sizing.”<br/>And the first thing to think about is how much of your capital you’re willing to<br/>lose. What if you lose five trades in a row? What if you’re completely voodoo-<br/>hexed and you lose 10 trades in a row? No matter what happens, preserving your<br/>capital to make it to another trade is your first goal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>So how much is just right? That’s up to you. But, for starters, putting all of your<br/>capital into one trade on something like long calls may not be a viable, long-term<br/>strategy. You might get lucky and make money at first, but if that’s your trade<br/>management strategy, eventually what the market giveth, the market will taketh.<br/>Take    it from veteran traders, you’re only as good as your last trade.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">Trust the math (and your gut)</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Position sizing comes down to a couple of things—how much you have, how<br/>much you’re willing to lose, and some math. None of these are arbitrary, but they<br/>don’t take rocket science to figure out, either.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>You should already know what you have, so how much you’re willing to lose is<br/>more of a gut check.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Is risking 100% of your account on one trade a bad idea? Probably. But what<br/>about 10%? How about 5%, or 2%? Check your pulse as the numbers go down<br/>and imagine losing that amount. Let that sink in, it’s important. If you lost a<br/>certain percentage of your account on one trade, is that a loss you can absorb?<br/>If 10% is too hot, and 2% feels too cold, but 5% feels just right, lock it in your<br/>plan and promise Goldilocks you’ll never break your “5% rule” again. (Not a</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>recommendation here, simply for illustrative and educational purposes. It is up to<br/>you to gauge and consider. Actual values will vary.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">From there, the math with options is simple.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><b>Sizing up a long option trade: </b>If you’re trading a buy strategy like <span style=" color: #00C805;">long calls<br/>and long puts </span>or <span style=" color: #00C805;">debit spreads</span><span>, it’s the cost of the trade divided into your total<br/>risk per trade.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>For example, if Savvy Savannah has $10,000 in trading capital and applies the 5%<br/>rule, that’s $500 in max risk per trade. If the price of an option is $2.50, ($250<br/>total per option), Savannah could buy 2 of those options. If a debit spread also<br/>costs $2.50, the formula is the same and Savannah could buy 2 spreads. (Note: It<br/>doesn’t have to be all at once. Savannah can scale into positions through<br/>multiple purchases or sales of a contract or spread).</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sizing up a short option trade: <span class="p">For short strategies like credit spreads, the risk<br/>in each spread is the difference between the strikes minus the credit you receive.<br/>For example, same $10,000 account, and same 5% rule. If you received $2 on a<br/>credit spread that is $5 between strikes, your risk is $3 ($300 total per spread).</span></h2><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Since you can’t go over $500 risk, you can only trade one spread.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cool. I’m a position sizing Jedi now. What can go wrong?</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Well, a lot, Padawan. It’s worth mentioning that someone reading this (you might<br/>be one of them) might be thinking, “5%? No problem. I’ll just cut up my account<br/>into 20 trades at 5% each.” It doesn’t work like that.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>As a general practice, you don’t necessarily want to use all of your capital just<br/>because it’s there. Consider starting with one at a time, at least while you’re<br/>learning and work your way up to a level that’s comfortable. The 5% rule isn’t<br/>about 5% dispersed across 20 trades, it’s 5% of what’s left in your account after<br/>you close this one. This means if the account goes down in value, your trade size<br/>also goes down. If your account increases, your trade size could go up. For many<br/>people, it can be good to continually reassess if 5% of a larger portfolio still fits<br/>your risk appetite.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Think of it this way: if Savannah spent 5% of $10,000 on 20 trades and all of them<br/>went to zero, she would be left with zero (assuming she&#39;s not trading on margin,<br/>she&#39;d probably hit zero quicker). However, if Savannah placed 20 trades, one<br/>trade at time, and spent 5% on the remaining capital, she could lose 100% of 20<br/>trades in a row and still have $3,774 left in her trading account.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>That’s an example of how proper trade management can work—lowering your<br/>risk per trade if your account falls, while reducing your overall risk so you don’t</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>blow up your entire account (trader speak for going broke). Position sizing is just<br/>one way to control some of the risk that exists between your ears.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Delta, delta, delta</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>One last thing. Just because you’ve allocated a smaller loss per trade, doesn’t<br/>mean your work is done. There’s still strike selection, and more importantly, what<br/>strikes to consider avoiding. Just as risking all of your capital on one trade is a<br/>recipe for disaster, buying a bunch of cheap, </span><span style=" color: #00C805;">out of the money </span><span>calls for $0.10<br/>each can be just as bad. One way to gauge your odds of potential risk is to look<br/>at the option’s </span><i>Delta</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta is one of those fancy “options greeks” you might have heard about<br/>somewhere. We’ll spend some time in other articles discussing greeks, but delta<br/>is  worth highlighting here. Delta is like a swiss army knife for analyzing risk. Let’s<br/>quickly break it down:</span></p><ul id="l15"><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>Delta is the option’s price sensitivity to price changes in the underlying<br/>stock. If a call has a .10, or “10 delta” and the stock moves up $1.00, the<br/>option will only increase .10 cents in value. Not so great if you thought the<br/>option was going to move in lockstep with the stock.</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>Another way traders use delta is as a back of the napkin calculation for<br/>probability of the option expiring in the money at expiration. Our example<br/>call  with a .10 delta has roughly a 10% chance of expiring in the money.<br/>Another way of thinking about this is the seller has about a 90% chance of<br/>keeping the credit you paid them. Think about that.</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;"><span>And finally traders use delta to calculate the equivalent “shares” that the<br/>option is acting like. So, even though you may be buying a 10 delta option,<br/>a lot of small deltas add up to big deltas, and before you know it, you’re<br/>long thousands of deltas. That would be the equivalent of owning<br/>thousands of shares of stock (spidey senses activated, call the Risk Officer!).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Bottom line, deep, out of the money options are cheaper for a reason. They have<br/>a very low probability of success. In fact, many veteran traders call them “lottery<br/>tickets” because they are cheap, and rarely pay off. Of course when they do,<br/>you’re sure to hear about it, but trust us, it’s the exception that proves the rule.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">You can find delta on Robinhood by following the steps below:</p><ol id="l16"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Tap the Search icon at the bottom of your app</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Search for a stock symbol</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">In the Stock Information Page, tap Trade, then Trade Options</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Select the expiration at the top of the screen</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Select the option from the chain you want to trade</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Under “Limit Price,” select the bid/ask and you’ll see this:</p></li></ol></li></ul></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>The delta in this image is 0.3956, but that can be read as “39 deltas”—the<br/>equivalent of 39, almost 40 shares of stock. The option has roughly a 39% chance<br/>of expiring in the money by expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>At the money options hover right around 50 deltas, which means they’re<br/>expected to move $0.50 for every $1 move in the stock. So, if you’d like to<br/>emulate  a similar profit/loss profile of 100 shares of stock, you could buy two at<br/>the money options. When the stock moves up $1, the two contracts that are at<br/>the money are expected to move up $1 as well. The reverse is true if the stock<br/>moves lower by $1.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>The why of delta is for another article, but the important point to understand is<br/>that it’s not linear. Delta changes, like the slope of a curve, and cheap out of the<br/>money options have an extremely low delta. There’s a sweet spot between the at<br/>the money and cheaper out of the money options that may offer a balance of<br/>cost and a higher probability of success.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Also, keep in mind, whenever you buy an option (no matter whether it is ITM,<br/>ATM, OTM), your theoretical probability of success is less than 50/50. It’s just how<br/>the math works out. And remember, the higher the delta, the greater the<br/>probability that the option could be in the money at expiration. For now, let that<br/>be   your guide.</span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">And that’s a wrap</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Remember, you are the Chief Risk Officer of your trading account!

The theoretical max profit would be<br/>unlimited because there’s no upper limit on how much the stock can potentially<br/>gain. You also know that you need the price to hit $239 to break even at<br/>expiration. The breakeven price for a long call is the strike price (237) plus the<br/>premium paid ($2). The theoretical max you can lose (max loss) is going to be</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">$200, which is the premium paid ($2 x the contract multiplier of 100).</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this graph is only showing potential profit and loss at expiration.<br/>Actual gains may vary prior to expiration.

In exchange for this right<br/>(known as the ability to “exercise” the option) you pay an upfront cost (the<br/>“premium”). A typical long call option offers the right to buy 100 shares of the<br/>underlying stock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Because you have this right, it is beneficial for the stock price to increase in value.<br/>Your potential gain is theoretically infinite, while your risk of potential losses is<br/>limited to the premium you paid.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Here’s some lingo to describe how your long call option is performing relative to<br/>the stock price:</span></p><ul id="l17"><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">In-the-money: <span class="p">The stock price is above the strike price</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">At-the-money: <span class="p">The stock price is at the strike price</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Out-of-the-money: <span class="p">The stock price is below the strike price</span></h2><h1 style="padding-top: 14pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When might I use this strategy?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">You might consider <b>buying </b><span>a call if you seek to benefit from an upward<br/>movement in a stock price (i.e., you have a bullish outlook), without actually<br/>owning  the underlying shares. Your maximum potential gain is unlimited,<br/>because theoretically there’s no cap on how high a stock price can rise. On the<br/>other hand, if the stock price is below the strike price at expiration, your option<br/>expires worthless. When this happens, you would realize your maximum<br/>potential loss, which is the premium you paid upfront.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How is buying a call option different from buying shares in a company?</h2><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Instead of buying a call on a company you think will increase in value, you can<br/>buy shares in the company itself. While both strategies can give you upside<br/>exposure on an equivalent number of shares, there are some key differences.<br/>First, options have an expiration date, whereas shares do not — in other words,<br/>you can only exercise or sell your call until its expiration date, but shares typically<br/>do not have the same time constraints or risks. A call option can and may expire<br/>worthless. Second, you generally need less upfront capital to buy a call option<br/>than   to buy shares to gain an equivalent level of exposure. As such, options can<br/>magnify your gains or losses based on your initial investment.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are factors to consider when buying a call?</h1></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Expiration date: <span class="p">If you want to either sell or exercise your option, you<br/>must do so by this date. If you don’t, the option expires, and you no longer<br/>have the right to buy the underlying stock at the strike price. Assuming all<br/>other factors are constant, the further away an option’s expiration date,<br/>the lower your risk of loss.That’s because there’s more time for the stock<br/>price to potentially rise. For that reason, options with later expiration dates<br/>are likely to have higher premiums.</span></h2></li><li data-list-text=""><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Strike price: <span class="p">This is the price you pay for the underlying stock if you<br/>choose to exercise the option, regardless of the price at which the stock is<br/>trading (“prevailing market price”). Assuming all other factors are constant,<br/>a call option with a higher strike price typically involves a greater risk of<br/>loss than a call option with a lower strike price.

Since you expect MEOW shares to rise, you decide to </span><b>pay </b><span>a $2<br/>premium per share (or $200 in total) to </span><b>buy </b><span>one call option on MEOW. This gives<br/>you the right to purchase 100 MEOW shares at a strike price of $120.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Potential Gains or Losses at Expiration</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If, at expiration, MEOW shares exceed the strike price plus premium paid per<br/>share, you can potentially profit on your long call. In our example, if MEOW rises<br/>above $122 ($120 strike price + $2 premium) and you exercise (and sell shares)<br/>or sell your option, then you should make a profit. Theoretically, your maximum<br/>gain is unlimited, since MEOW could rise to any number. Meanwhile, your<br/>potential maximum loss should be limited to the premium you paid upfront ($2<br/>per share * 100 shares = $200).</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MEOW rises to $130 (aka in-the-money)</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s see what happens if your expectation is right, and the stock climbs to $130<br/>before expiration. If you </span><b>exercise </b><span>the option, your potential profit per share is the<br/>difference between the stock price and the strike price, minus the premium ($130<br/>stock price - $120 strike price - $2 premium = $8 per share). If the contract is for<br/>100 shares, you would </span><b>earn </b>$800. Alternatively, if you <b>sell </b><span>the option, your<br/>potential profit per share is the difference between the sale price and the<br/>premium  you initially paid to enter the long call.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MEOW stays at $110 (aka out-of-the-money)</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Now, let’s look at what happens if the stock doesn’t move as you expected.<br/>Instead of going up, the stock price stays at $110 until the option expires. Since<br/>that’s below the strike price of $120, the call should expire worthless, and you<br/>would lose the $2 premium per share, or $200 for the contract (the most you<br/>could </span><b>lose </b>on the trade in this example).</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this is a theoretical example. Actual gains and losses will depend<br/>on factors such as the prices and number of contracts involved.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the breakeven stock price at expiration?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You break even on your long call if the stock closes at the strike price of the<br/>option plus the premium you paid.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Going back to MEOW, the strike price ($120) plus the premium ($2) is $122. If the<br/>stock closes at this exact number on the option’s expiration date (and you<br/>exercise and sell shares, or sell your option), you neither profit nor lose money. If<br/>the stock rises above $122, you have the potential to profit. If it closes at or<br/>below the strike price the call should expire worthless, and you’ll lose the<br/>premium you paid upfront.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I bought a call option. What can I do next?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>When you buy a call option, you have two choices before the expiration date:<br/>exercise it or sell it.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exercising</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You can exercise a call anytime before it expires to use your right to buy 100<br/>shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. The seller of the call is obligated<br/>to sell the shares to you at this price. You might choose to exercise a call if the<br/>stock price goes higher than your breakeven price (the strike price plus the<br/>premium you paid). In this case, you buy the stock at a discount and can either<br/>sell  the shares for a profit or hold them (and perhaps sell them later). Another<br/>reason you might exercise a call is if you can’t sell it for its intrinsic value (the<br/>difference between the stock price and the strike price). If that happens,<br/>exercising   it and then selling shares might be the only way to fully realize your<br/>potential gains.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selling to close</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Instead of exercising a call, you could choose to sell it anytime before the<br/>expiration date to try to realize gains or prevent further losses. If the stock price<br/>rises above the breakeven point anytime before the expiration date, selling the<br/>call could allow you to realize a profit. That’s because the contract should be<br/>more valuable than when you bought it, since it gives the owner a right to buy<br/>shares for less than the prevailing market price.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If it doesn’t look like the stock price will rise higher than the break even point by<br/>the expiration date, you could potentially sell the call to get some of your<br/>premium back. (A buyer could be interested because there’s still a chance the<br/>stock price will increase in the time left.) You might also sell your call if you don’t<br/>have enough money to exercise it. In other words, you can’t afford to buy 100<br/>shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Of course, you can also choose to do nothing and let the call option expire<br/>worthless. In this case, you’ll lose the premium you paid for it.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How might market movements affect my position?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Changes in the market can affect the value of your call option, since the price of a<br/>call is based on supply and demand for the contract.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Some options may not be as liquid as others. For instance, there might not be<br/>enough buyers for you to sell-to-close the position, and your contract’s price<br/>might  be adversely affected. If your option isn’t very liquid, it can be hard to sell it<br/>for its intrinsic value or at all. The premium might not always correspond directly<br/>to price changes in the underlying stock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Volatility, a measure of how much and how quickly a stock price changes, can<br/>also affect your position. If you buy a call, you generally benefit when volatility<br/>increases, because the value of your call should also increase, assuming all other<br/>factors are constant. Likewise, the option is likely to decrease in value when<br/>volatility declines.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Finally, the value of your call may decrease as the expiration date nears. That’s<br/>because it becomes less likely that the stock price will change significantly before<br/>the option expires (a factor known as time decay), and because it may be harder<br/>to find buyers for a less liquid option.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are some potential edge cases?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>When buying a call, there’s no risk of early assignment or dividend risk.

In exchange, you receive an upfront amount<br/>(the “premium”) for selling this contract. A typical short call option entails the<br/>obligation to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock, and the call is “covered”<br/>because you already own the shares you might have to sell.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Because you have this obligation and hold the stock, in general it is beneficial for<br/>the stock price to stay relatively flat or increase moderately, and undesirable for<br/>the stock price to fall significantly.

If<br/>you’re planning to hold the underlying shares anyway, selling covered calls can<br/>be a way to help generate income from the premiums you </span><b>receive </b><span>(aka to<br/>“monetize” your holdings). But there’s a tradeoff — You give up the potential to<br/>profit if the stock price soars above the strike price. When this happens, the call<br/>has the potential to be assigned. (Note: Calls are usually assigned at expiration,<br/>but can happen at any time beforehand.) Remember, you’re obligated</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">to <b>sell </b>your shares at the strike price if the buyer chooses to exercise the option.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Selling a covered call can also be a way to help protect yourself if the stock price<br/>declines. The premium you received for the call can slightly offset your losses.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Still, <b>selling </b><span>a call can’t protect you from losing money if the stock price falls<br/>below the breakeven price.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are factors to consider?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Here are a few key factors:</p><h2 style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Expiration date: <span class="p">Selling calls with a closer expiration date means you’re reducing<br/>the time frame in which you’re capping your potential gains from the stock you<br/>own. If they expire worthless, you can sell calls more often. Selling calls that<br/>expire later means you cap your potential profit for longer and can’t write new<br/>calls as often. However, calls with a later expiration date usually generate higher<br/>premiums upfront, assuming all other factors are constant.</span></h2><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Strike price: <span class="p">This is the price at which you’re required to sell your shares if the<br/>call is assigned. Assuming all other factors are constant, calls with lower strike</span></h2><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>prices are more likely to be assigned and typically sell for a higher premium. Calls<br/>with a higher strike price are less likely to be assigned and usually have a lower<br/>premium. A higher strike price gives you more leeway to benefit from a rise in<br/>the  stock price, since the ceiling on your potential gains is higher.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Contract: <span class="p">Each option typically represents 100 shares. If you sell more covered<br/>calls, the total premium you receive is higher. But you also need to own more<br/>shares of stock to cover the calls — and if the price of the stock you own<br/>increases, there’s potential for you to miss out on even greater gains. However,<br/>selling covered calls also offers some downside protection, since the premium<br/>you receive can partially offset a decrease in the stock price.</span></h2><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Premium: <span class="p">This is the money you receive upfront for selling the call.

Since this is above the strike price of $125, the call is<br/>assigned, and you are obligated to </span><b>sell </b><span>your shares for $125 each. Your gain per<br/>share is $15, or the strike price ($125) minus the price you </span><b>paid </b><span>for the stock<br/>($110).

Keep in mind, this is<br/>your maximum potential gain in this example. Even though the stock price rose<br/>to $130, the strike price ($125) of the option limits your potential gains. By<br/>comparison, if you had only bought and held 100 shares, the value of your stock<br/>would’ve increased by $2,000 — that is, ($130 - $110) * 100 shares.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">MEOW rises to $125 (aka at-the-money)</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s say MEOW’s stock price closes at $125 on the call’s expiration date. Since<br/>this is at the strike price, the call should expire worthless. Once again, your gain<br/>per share is the current stock price ($125) minus the price you </span><b>paid </b><span>for the stock<br/>($110), which equals $15. If the contract is for 100 shares, you would gain $1,500<br/>from owning the stock. To calculate your total gain though, add the $1 premium<br/>you </span><b>received </b><span>per share for selling a call option ($100 total). In this instance, your<br/>total profit for the strategy is $1,500 plus $100, or $1,600.

Multiply this by the 100 shares you own,<br/>and this comes to -$1,000. The premium you received upfront ($100) helps offset<br/>this decline, meaning your net loss is $900. If you had only bought and held the<br/>shares, your net loss would’ve been $1,000.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this is a theoretical example.

What can happen next?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>When you sell a covered call option, there are several possibilities for what could<br/>happen next: Buying to close your position, assignment, or expiration.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Buying to close</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>By selling a call option against your shares, you create an “open” position. You<br/>can later “close” it by buying back the option, anytime before it expires, which<br/>can allow you to keep your stock and avoid getting assigned. Holding the stock<br/>also gives you the potential to sell additional covered calls once the collateral<br/>(your shares) is freed up.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Assignment</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">Alternatively, the call you <b>sold </b><span>could get assigned (meaning the buyer decides to<br/>exercise it). Remember, since you’re the seller, you can’t exercise it — Only the<br/>buyer can do this. If you’re </span><b>assigned</b><span>, then you must sell the stock at the strike<br/>price. Often, this happens if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration.<br/>But a call can be </span><b>assigned </b><span>early, too. This is especially likely to happen before ex-<br/>dividend dates, the last day by which you can </span><b>buy </b><span>a stock in order to be eligible<br/>to receive dividends on the shares. If early assignment happens before the ex-<br/>dividend date, you will not be entitled to the dividend.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Call Expiration</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price is below the strike price at expiration, your call will likely expire<br/>worthless. This would free up your shares, allowing you to potentially: sell<br/>another  call, keep holding the stock, or sell your shares.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How might market movements affect my position?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Changes in the market can affect the value of your covered call and your ability<br/>to close it. First, you can benefit from an increase in the price of the underlying<br/>stock, since you own those shares. However, this is only true up to the strike<br/>price, which puts a limit on your potential gains. Also, as the stock price rises, the<br/>value of your short call position declines.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Volatility, a measure of how much and how quickly a stock price changes, can<br/>also affect your position. If you sell a covered call, you generally benefit when<br/>volatility declines, because the value of the call you sold should also decline,<br/>assuming all other factors are constant. On the other hand, an increase in<br/>volatility  in the underlying stock can make it more expensive to close your<br/>position.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price and volatility stay pretty flat, the value of your covered call<br/>position tends to increase as time passes. As the expiration date nears, the price<br/>of the short call falls, making it less expensive to potentially close the position.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are some potential edge cases?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>For selling a covered call, two of the more common edge cases are: Early<br/>assignment risk and dividend risk.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early assignment risk</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>An early assignment occurs when the contract a trader sold is exercised before its<br/>expiration date. If a trader is assigned on the short call option, the trader will be<br/>obligated to sell their shares of stock at the covered call’s strike price. In this case,<br/>a trader will no longer own the shares associated with the covered call option,<br/>and see an increase in buying power in their Robinhood brokerage account.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Learn more about early assignments <span class="s2">here</span>.</p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Dividend risk</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Dividend risk is the risk that a trader will be assigned on a short call option the<br/>night before the ex-dividend date (and thus, not receive the dividend).

In exchange for this right<br/>(known as the ability to “exercise” the option), you pay an upfront cost (the<br/>“premium”). A typical long put option offers the right to sell 100 shares of the<br/>underlying stock.

Remember, since you’re<br/>the seller of the put, you can’t exercise it — Only the buyer can do this. If the<br/>buyer decides to exercise their put, then you must buy the stock at the strike<br/>price. Often, this happens if the stock price is below the strike price at expiration.<br/>A put could also be assigned early, but because you sold a cash-covered put, you<br/>have already accepted the obligation to buy shares at the strike price and have<br/>the cash collateral to do so.

If you sell a covered put, you generally benefit when<br/>volatility declines, since the value of the option you sold should also decrease,<br/>assuming other factors stay constant. On the other hand, an increase in volatility<br/>in   the underlying stock can make it more expensive to buy-to-close the position.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price and volatility stay relatively flat, the value of your cash-covered<br/>put option tends to decrease as time passes. As the expiration date nears, it<br/>becomes less likely that the stock will drop below the strike price, and more likely<br/>that the option will expire worthless, allowing you to keep the premium.

You<br/>decide to open a strangle: You pay a $2 premium per share to buy one call<br/>option giving you the right to purchase HISS shares at a strike price of $110. You<br/>also pay a $3 premium per share to buy one put option giving you the right to<br/>sell HISS shares at a strike price of $90. Notice that the long call has a higher<br/>strike price than the long put.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maximum Gain or Loss</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price increases, your maximum potential gain is theoretically infinite,<br/>since there is no ceiling on how much the stock price can rise. You could also<br/>profit if the stock price decreases, but there is a limit on how low a stock price<br/>can drop ($0). On the other hand, the maximum potential loss is limited to the<br/>two premiums you paid upfront ($2 + $3 = $5 per share). Assuming the options<br/>represent 100 shares, you could lose up to $500 total in this example.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>HISS falls to $80 (aka in-the-money put, out-of-the-<br/>money call)</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s see what happens if the stock price falls to $80 at expiration. If you sell the<br/>put option, your potential gain per share is the difference between the put’s<br/>strike price and the stock price, minus the premium ($90 strike price - $80 stock<br/>price - $5 premium = $5 per share). If the contract is for 100 shares, you’d gain</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">$500. Your call option should expire worthless since it’s out-of-the-money.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>HISS rises to $120 (aka in-the-money call, out-of-the-<br/>money put)</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Instead, say the stock price rises to $120. If you sell the call option, your potential<br/>gain per share is the difference between the stock price and the call’s strike price,<br/>minus the premium ($120 stock price - $110 strike price - $5 premium = $5 per<br/>share). If the contract is for 100 shares, you would again gain $500. Your put<br/>option should expire worthless since it’s out-of-the-money.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HISS stays at $100 (out-of-the-money call and put)</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s consider what happens if things don’t go as you expected, and the stock<br/>price stays at $100. Both of your options should expire worthless because they<br/>are both out-of-the-money. Your loss per share is the total premium you paid for<br/>both options ($5), or $500 in total. This is the most you could lose on the trade in<br/>this example.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this is a theoretical example. Actual gains and losses will depend<br/>on factors such as the prices and number of contracts involved.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is the breakeven point at expiration?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">There are <b>two breakeven points </b><span>on a straddle or a strangle: You break even if<br/>the stock closes either above the call strike price (“higher breakeven point”) or<br/>below the put strike price (“lower breakeven point”) by the amount of total</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>premium you paid upfront. (Remember, the options have the same strike price in<br/>a straddle.)</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Going back to HISS strangle, the strike price of the long put ($90) minus the<br/>premium per share ($5) is $85. If the stock closes at the lower breakeven point on<br/>the expiration date, you neither gain nor lose money. You can sell or exercise the<br/>long put, while the long call should expire worthless. If the stock closes below</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">$85, you could realize a gain.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>To calculate the second breakeven point, add the strike price of the long call to<br/>the premium per share ($110 + $5 = $115). If the stock closes at the higher<br/>breakeven point on the expiration date, you neither gain nor lose money. You<br/>can    sell or exercise the long call, while the long put should expire worthless. If the<br/>stock closes above $115, you could realize a gain.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock stays between $85 and $115 until expiration, you can potentially lose<br/>money. Again, in using this strategy, you’re expecting a dramatic move in the<br/>stock price.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I bought a strangle or a straddle. What can I do next?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>When you open a straddle or strangle, you have two choices before the<br/>expiration date: Exercise one of your options or sell them.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Exercising</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You can exercise a call or put anytime before it expires to use your right to buy or<br/>sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price. You might choose</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">to <b>exercise a call </b>if the stock price <b>exceeds your higher breakeven point</b><span>, or<br/>you might </span><b>exercise a put </b>if the stock price goes <b>below your lower breakeven</b><span>. Exercising an option might make sense if you have the necessary collateral<br/>(either cash or shares) to buy or sell the stocks at the strike price. Another reason<br/>you might exercise a call or put is if you can’t sell it for its intrinsic value (the</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>difference between the stock price and the strike price). If that happens,<br/>exercising it and then selling shares might be the only way to fully realize your<br/>potential gains.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Selling</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Instead of exercising your options, you could choose to sell them anytime before<br/>the expiration date to try to realize gains or prevent further losses. If the stock<br/>price goes beyond one of the breakeven points anytime before expiration, selling<br/>that option could allow you to realize a gain. That’s because the contract should<br/>now be more valuable than when you bought it, since it gives the owner the right<br/>to buy shares for less (call option), or sell them for more (put option), than the<br/>prevailing market price.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If it doesn’t look like the stock price will move past one of the breakeven points<br/>by the expiration date, you can sell the options to try to get some of your<br/>premium back. (A buyer could be interested because there’s still a chance the<br/>stock price will move dramatically in the time left.) You might also sell your<br/>options if you don’t have enough assets to exercise them. In other words, you<br/>can’t afford to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price, or you<br/>don’t have the shares available to sell.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Of course, you can also choose to do nothing and let the options expire<br/>worthless.In this case, you’ll experience a loss equal to the total premium you<br/>paid upfront.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How might market movements affect my position?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Changes in the market can affect the value of your options and your ability to sell<br/>them. First, some options aren’t as liquid as others. This means there may not be<br/>enough buyers or sellers to allow you to buy or sell without adversely affecting<br/>your contracts’ price. If your option isn’t very liquid, it can be hard to sell it for its<br/>intrinsic value.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Also, the price of an option (aka its premium) is based on the supply and<br/>demand for the contract. That means the premium might not always correspond<br/>to price changes in the underlying stock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Volatility, a measure of how much and how quickly a stock price changes, can<br/>also affect your position. If you buy a straddle or strangle, you generally benefit<br/>when volatility increases, because the value of your call and put should also<br/>increase, assuming all other factors are constant. Likewise, the option is likely to<br/>decrease in value when volatility declines.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price stays relatively flat, the premiums on your options may decrease<br/>as the expiration date nears. That’s because it becomes less likely that the stock<br/>price will change significantly before the options expire (a factor known as time<br/>decay).</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are some potential edge cases?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>When buying a strangle or straddle, there’s no risk of early assignment or<br/>dividend risk.

This is because the<br/>positions you hold are used to calculate your buying power, and at the time<br/>you’re assigned you may not have the shares (for call spreads) or buying power<br/>(for put spreads) needed to cover the deficit in your account.

When you have an account deficit, there<br/>are  a few potential actions that you can take, including exercising your long<br/>contract or buying/selling shares. If you have an account deficit and choose to</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>exercise your long contract to increase your buying power, you will not be able<br/>to open new positions while your exercise is pending.

When you have a margin call,<br/>there are a few potential actions that you can take: exercising your long contract,<br/>buying/selling shares by placing orders, or depositing enough funds to cover the<br/>margin  call. If you have a margin call and choose to exercise your long contract<br/>to decrease your margin deficiency, your margin call may persist while your<br/>exercise is pending or, further, if the exercise was not sufficient enough to cover<br/>your margin deficit. If exercising your long contract is sufficient to cover your<br/>margin deficiency, any margin calls should be satisfied once your exercise is<br/>processed.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early Assignment and Exercise</h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind that we can’t process an early assignment before the end of the<br/>trading day and, so we can’t exercise the long leg until the next trading day (at<br/>the earliest).

It comes with a risk of limited losses and the potential</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>for limited profit. The strategy involves one short call and one long call on the<br/>same underlying stock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you open a call credit spread, you <b>sell a call (at a lower strike</b></p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">price) <span class="p">and </span>buy a call (at a higher strike price) <span class="p">both expiring on the same day.<br/>This strategy is also known as a bear call spread or a short call spread.</span></h2><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When might I use this strategy?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You may consider a call credit spread when you expect the price of the<br/>underlying stock to remain relatively flat or fall before a certain date (i.e., you<br/>have   a neutral to bearish outlook). If your expectation is met, this strategy can<br/>allow you to earn a limited profit while capping your potential losses.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">At the outset, you <b>receive </b><span>a premium for the contract you sold (the short call)<br/>and </span><b>pay </b><span>a premium for the contract you bought (the long call). You start with<br/>a </span><b>net credit </b>since the premium you collect for the short call is greater than the</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><span>premium you pay for the long call. This net credit is the maximum profit you can<br/>earn using this strategy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>But if things don’t go as expected, your potential losses are limited, too. If the<br/>price of the underlying stock sharply increases, the long call constrains how much<br/>money you could lose. (It gives you the right to buy shares at a higher price if<br/>you  are obligated to cover an assignment on the short call.)</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span>How is a call credit spread different from only selling a<br/>call?</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Only selling a call is another choice if you have a relatively bearish to neutral<br/>outlook on a stock — You may think the price of the underlying stock will fall in<br/>the future, or at least not reach the strike price before the option expires. If the<br/>stock price closes below the strike price on the expiration date, the option you<br/>sold should expire worthless, allowing you to pocket the entire premium.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>However, unlike a call credit spread, only selling a call on stock you don’t own<br/>may involve the risk of unlimited losses — This strategy is also known as selling a<br/>naked or uncovered call. Here’s how: If the stock soars above the strike price and<br/>the buyer of the option decides to exercise it, you have no choice but to buy the<br/>stock at the prevailing market price to supply the shares. You lose the difference<br/>between the strike price and the market price, which theoretically, can be infinite,<br/>since there’s no limit on how high a stock price could go.</span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Please note: Robinhood does not allow uncovered or “naked” positions.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With a call credit spread, you can benefit if the stock price falls, but you also cap<br/>your potential losses in case the stock price climbs. That’s because you also<br/>bought the right to purchase the stock, albeit at a higher strike price than the<br/>option that you sold.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Calculations</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can I see an example?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With a call credit spread, your maximum potential gain is the net credit you<br/>received when you opened the spread. Remember, this is what you’re left with<br/>after buying a call and selling a call to construct the spread. You realize your<br/>maximum potential profit if the stock price at expiration is equal to or below the<br/>strike price of the short call. If this happens, both calls expire worthless, and you<br/>keep the net credit.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Setting up a Call Credit Spread</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><span>For example, imagine the fictional MEOW company is trading at $100 per share.<br/>You’re pessimistic about the company’s outlook and decide to open a call credit<br/>spread on MEOW. Here’s how it works:</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">You <b>sell one call option </b>with a strike price of $110, <b>receiving </b><span>a $5<br/>premium per share (this is the short call).</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, you <b>buy one call option </b>with a strike price of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$115, <b>paying </b>a premium of $2 per share (this is the long call).</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Both calls have the same expiration date.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Note: The long call is less expensive than the short call because it’s further<br/>out of the money.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maximum potential gain</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>The net credit you receive is $3 per share ($5 received - $2 paid). An options<br/>contract typically represents 100 shares, so your maximum potential profit is $3<br/>multiplied by 100 shares, or $300. You can achieve this if the stock trades at $110<br/>or  less at expiration.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maximum potential loss</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>But, if the stock rallies, you may experience a loss. The maximum loss you can<br/>experience on a call credit spread is the difference between the strike prices<br/>minus   the net credit received. (I.e., You buy the underlying shares at the higher<br/>strike price and are obligated to sell them at the lower strike price for a loss, but<br/>get to keep the net credit.) This theoretical maximum loss may occur if the stock<br/>price is equal to or above the strike price of the long call — the higher strike<br/>price — at expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the MEOW example, the difference between the strike prices ($115 - $110) is</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>$5. Subtracting the net credit received ($3) leaves $2. So, the maximum amount<br/>you could lose per share is $2. If each contract represents 100 shares, that means<br/>potentially losing up to $200. You would lose this amount if the stock price is</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">$115 or higher when the options expire.</p><p style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this is a theoretical example. Actual gains and losses will depend<br/>on factors such as the prices, number of contracts involved, and whether the<br/>stock pays a dividend.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s the breakeven point at expiration?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You break even with a call credit spread if, on the expiration date, the stock price<br/>closes at the strike price of the short call (the lower strike price) plus the net<br/>credit received.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>In the MEOW example, the strike price of the short call is $110, and the net credit<br/>is $3. Adding $110 and $3 comes to $113. So you will break even if MEOW’s<br/>stock price closes at $113 on the contracts’ expiration date (the short call gets<br/>assigned and you sell MEOW shares at $110 while buying shares at $113, and the<br/>long call expires worthless). If the stock price falls anywhere below $113, you<br/>should profit.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>I opened a call credit spread.

You can do this by<br/>taking the opposite actions that you took to open the position. In the case of a<br/>call credit spread, you would simultaneously buy-to-close the short call option<br/>(the one you initially sold to open) and sell-to-close the long call option (the one<br/>you initially bought to open). In general, you can close a spread up until 4:00 pm<br/>ET on its expiration date on Robinhood. You may consider closing the spread if<br/>you want to realize your gains or prevent further losses.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What could happen at expiration?</h1></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 17pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">If the stock price is <b>equivalent to or lower than the short strike price</b><span>,<br/>then both options should expire worthless, allowing you to keep the entire<br/>net credit you received when you opened the spread.</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">If the stock price is <b>above the short strike price and below the long</b><span>, then the long call option should expire worthless.

You can exercise your long call within a call<br/>credit spread if you have sufficient funds to do so. Remember, the shares you<br/>purchase will be held as collateral for your short call until it is closed, expires<br/>worthless, or is assigned (in which case you have to sell your shares). This helps<br/>prevent you from being exposed to the risks of an uncovered position — that is,<br/>having a short call option without having the necessary collateral.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are some potential edge cases?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>For call credit spreads, two of the more common edge cases involve early<br/>assignment risk and dividend risk.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early assignment risk</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>An early assignment occurs when the contract a trader sold is exercised before its<br/>expiration date.

It comes with a risk of limited losses and the<br/>potential for limited profit. The strategy involves one short put and one long put<br/>on  the same underlying stock.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When you open a put credit spread, you <b>sell a put (at a higher strike</b></p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">price) <span class="p">and </span>buy a put (at a lower strike price)<span class="p">, both expiring on the same day.<br/>This strategy is also called a bull put spread or a short put spread.</span></h2><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When might I use this strategy?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You may consider a put credit spread when you expect the price of the<br/>underlying stock to remain flat or increase before a certain date (i.e., you have a<br/>neutral to bullish outlook). If your expectation is met, this strategy can allow you<br/>to earn a limited profit while capping your potential losses.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">At the outset, you <b>receive </b><span>a premium for the contract you sold (the short put)<br/>and </span><b>pay </b><span>a premium for the contract you bought (the long put). You start with<br/>a </span><b>net credit</b>, since the premium you collect for the short put is greater than the</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>premium you pay for the long put. This net credit is the maximum profit you can<br/>earn using this strategy.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>But if things don’t go as expected, your potential losses are limited, too. If the<br/>price of the underlying stock sharply decreases, the long put limits how much<br/>money you could lose (It gives you the right to sell shares at a lower price if you<br/>are obligated to cover an assignment on the short put.)</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>How is a put credit spread different from only selling a<br/>put?</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Only selling a put is another choice if you have a relatively bullish to neutral<br/>outlook on a stock — You may think the price of the underlying stock will climb<br/>in  the future, or at least not fall below the strike price before the option expires. If<br/>the stock closes above the strike price on the expiration date, the option expires<br/>worthless, allowing you to keep the premium as profit.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Yet compared to a put credit spread, only selling a put can involve risk of<br/>relatively greater losses. Here’s how: If the stock price plummets below the strike<br/>price and the buyer of the option decides to exercise it, you have no choice but<br/>to buy the underlying stock at the strike price to satisfy the put contract. This<br/>means you might have to pay far above the prevailing market price for the stock.<br/>Technically, there’s a limit on how much you could lose — After all, a stock price</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>can’t go below $0.

That’s because you also bought the right<br/>to sell the stock, albeit at a lower strike price than the option you sold.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Calculations</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can I see an example?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With a put credit spread, your maximum potential gain is the net credit you<br/>received when you opened the spread. Remember, this is what you’re left with<br/>after buying a put and selling a put to construct the spread. You should realize<br/>this maximum profit if the stock price is equal to or above the strike price of the<br/>short put at expiration. If this happens, both puts should expire worthless, and<br/>you’d keep the full net credit.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Setting up a put credit spread</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s see how this works with the fictional PURR company, now trading at $110<br/>per share. You’re optimistic about the company’s future and decide to open a<br/>put credit spread on PURR. Here’s how it works:</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">You <b>sell a put option </b>with a strike price of $95, <b>receiving </b><span>a $4 premium<br/>per share (this is the short put).</span></p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">At the same time, you <b>buy a put option </b>with a strike price of</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">$90, <b>paying </b>a $2 premium per share (this is the long put).</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Both puts have the same expiration date.</p></li><li data-list-text=""><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;">Note: The long put is cheaper because it’s further out of the money.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maximum potential gain</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>The maximum potential gain is the net credit you receive, which is $2 per share<br/>($4 received - $2 paid). An options contract typically represents 100 shares, so<br/>your maximum potential gain is $2 multiplied by 100 shares, or $200. This should<br/>happen if PURR trades at $95 or higher at expiration.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maximum potential loss</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If the stock price falls, you may experience a loss. The maximum potential loss is<br/>the difference between the higher and the lower strike prices, minus the net<br/>credit received. This may occur if the market price is at or below the strike price<br/>of the long put — the option with a lower strike price — at expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>In the PURR example, the difference between the strike prices ($95 - $90) is $5.<br/>Subtracting the net credit received ($2) leaves $3. So, the maximum amount you<br/>could potentially lose per share is $3. If each contract represents 100 shares, that<br/>means potentially losing up to $300. You would lose this amount if the stock<br/>price is $90 or lower at expiration.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Keep in mind, this is a theoretical example. Actual gains and losses will depend<br/>on factors such as the prices and number of contracts involved.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What’s the breakeven point at expiration?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><span>You break even with a put credit spread if, on the expiration date, the stock price<br/>closes at or below the strike price of the short put (the higher strike price) minus<br/>the net credit received.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Let’s go back to our PURR example. The strike price of the short put ($95) minus<br/>the net credit received ($2) is $93. So if PURR closes at $93 on the spread’s<br/>expiration date, you will neither gain nor lose money. If the stock price goes<br/>above   $93, you should make a profit; if it dips below the point, you’ll lose money.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Monitoring</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>I opened a put credit spread.

You can do this by<br/>taking the opposite actions that you took to open the position. In the case of a<br/>put credit spread, you would simultaneously </span><b>buy-to-close </b><span>the short put option<br/>(the one you initially sold to open) and </span><b>sell-to-close </b><span>the long put option (the<br/>one you initially bought to open).

You can exercise your long put within a put credit spread if<br/>you already own enough shares to deliver on the exercise (that is, selling the<br/>shares at the strike price). Remember, if you choose to do so, the cash generated<br/>from the sale of shares will be held as collateral for your short put until it is<br/>closed, expires worthless, or is assigned (in which case you buy the shares). This<br/>helps prevent you from being exposed to the risks of an uncovered or “naked”<br/>position — that is, having a short put option without having the necessary cash<br/>to cover it.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What are some potential edge cases?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>For put credit spreads, one of the more common edge cases involves early<br/>assignment risk.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Early assignment risk</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>An early assignment occurs when the contract a trader sold is exercised before its<br/>expiration date.

If this happens, you can realize your gain by closing the<br/>position. In theory, with a call option, your potential gain is unlimited, since a<br/>stock price can rise to virtually any number.

While<br/>this can allow you to reduce your costs, it also limits your potential gains.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Calculations</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can I see an example?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With a call debit spread, your maximum potential gain is the difference between<br/>the high strike price and low strike price, minus the net debit.

You hope to capitalize on your<br/>expectation, without the risk of relatively greater losses and expense of only<br/>buying     a put option. Instead, you can open a put debit spread, giving yourself<br/>the opportunity for a limited profit if your expectation comes true and capping<br/>your losses if it doesn’t.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">When you open a put debit spread, you <b>pay </b><span>a premium for the contract you buy<br/>(the long put) and </span><b>receive </b>a premium for the contract you sell (the short put).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">You begin with a <b>net debit </b><span>since the premium you paid for the long put is<br/>greater than the premium you collected for the short put.

The value of<br/>your long put may increase, but you might be assigned on your short put. On the<br/>other hand, if the stock price rises, you only risk losing the net debit you paid<br/>upfront (as both puts may expire worthless). The amount you paid for a put is<br/>partially offset by the amount you received for selling one. In exchange for<br/>capping potential losses, you are accepting a limit on your potential gains as well.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>How is a put debit spread different from only buying a<br/>put?</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>If you have a bearish outlook on a stock, you might consider only buying a put<br/>option — You may think the price of the underlying stock will decrease in the<br/>future, or at least fall below the strike price by an amount equal to the premium<br/>paid before the option expires (don’t worry, we’ll talk more about the breakeven<br/>point later). If this happens, you could potentially realize a profit by closing the<br/>position. Your maximum potential gain is quite large, as a stock price can<br/>theoretically fall all the way to $0. However, this is an unlikely outcome.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Meanwhile, if the option expires worthless, your loss is limited to the total<br/>premium you paid for the put.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>Similarly, if you open a put debit spread, you buy a put in hopes that the price of<br/>the underlying stock will decline. But, by selling a put at the same time (at a lower<br/>strike price), you pay a lower premium overall to open the position. While this<br/>can allow you to reduce your costs, it also limits your potential gains.</span></p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Calculations</h2><h1 style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Can I see an example?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>With a put debit spread, your maximum potential gain is the difference between<br/>the high strike price and the low strike price, minus the net debit.

You should realize this maximum potential gain if the stock price is equal<br/>to  or below the strike of the short put — the one with a lower strike price — at<br/>expiration.

It typically involves potential for limited profit and risk</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">of limited losses. The strategy essentially combines a <b>put credit spread </b><span>(a short<br/>put and a long put) and </span><b>call credit spread </b>(a short call and a long call).</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;">More specifically, an iron butterfly consists of <b>a long call </b><span>(at a higher strike<br/>price), </span><b>a long put </b>(at a lower strike price), and <b>a short call and put </b><span>(both at the<br/>same middle strike price). The upper and lower strike prices (the “wings”) are<br/>equidistant from the middle strike price (the “body”), and all four options have<br/>the  same expiration date. This strategy can also be thought of as the<br/>combination of a short straddle and a long strangle, or a call credit spread and<br/>put  debit spread.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When might I use this strategy?</h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You might consider an iron butterfly when you have a neutral outlook on a stock,<br/>meaning that you expect minimal movement in the underlying stock price over a<br/>certain period of time. The long strikes are typically out of the money and the<br/>short strikes are typically at the money. When charted on a profit/loss diagram,<br/>the trade roughly resembles a butterfly, with the long and short puts<br/>representing the left wing and the long and short calls creating the right wing.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You maximize your potential return if the stock remains at the middle strike price<br/>and all four options expire worthless, allowing you to keep the entire net credit<br/>received.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>You would break even if the stock price at expiration is equivalent to the middle<br/>strike price plus (or minus) the net credit received per share.

Each of these strategies consist of just two options, a long and a short, as<br/>opposed to the four options in an iron butterfly. As mentioned before, the iron<br/>butterfly is a neutral strategy in which you anticipate the stock price to remain<br/>relatively flat over a period of time. It’s also important to note that if the stock<br/>price  has moved past the break-even prices at expiration, you would likely<br/>experience losses.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: left;"><span>However, all these trades have some things in common.

When<br/>babies cry, they’re volatile. When they sleep—not so volatile.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>When traders talk about volatility, they’re generally talking about one of two<br/>things—the market/stock volatility as a function of price swings, or the implied<br/>volatility of options as a function of the price of options themselves. This is an<br/>important distinction.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Market or stock volatility comes as a result of the price swings you see on a daily<br/>basis. It’s real, measureable, and most importantly, it </span><i>has already happened</i>.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Traders refer to this as “historical” or “realized” volatility. It’s a measure<br/>of </span><i>past </i>volatility of the overall stock market, sector, or individual stock.</p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>With stocks, it’s a measure of how much its price changes in a given period of<br/>time. When a stock that normally trades in a 1% range of its price on a daily basis</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>suddenly trades 2-3% of its price, it’s considered to be experiencing “high<br/>volatility.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the other hand, “implied volatility” is the market’s <i>perception </i><span>of how much a<br/>stock—or the market itself—will move, and is reflected in the price of its options.<br/>Think of implied volatility as the options market’s best guess at </span><i>future </i>volatility.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>As with any guess, it’s not guaranteed it will hold true. Presented in percentages,<br/>an option with an implied volatility of 35% is saying that the underlying stock is<br/>expected to stay within a 35% (high to low) range over the next year.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>For example, let’s say our theoretical company Tiger, Inc. is trading at $100 per<br/>share and it has an implied volatility of 35%. This means that the options markets<br/>are forecasting that Tiger, Inc. could move </span><i>up or down </i><span>$35 in the next year. This<br/>would create an expected range of $65 to $135 for Tiger, Inc. over the next year.<br/>Meanwhile, the option’s prices for Tiger, Inc. will reflect this expected price range.<br/>Think about it—if Tiger, Inc. is not expected to trade above $135 or below $65 in<br/>the next year, any option outside that range will be relatively cheap. This is<br/>because the probability of those options being in-the-money are for the<br/>moment,  low.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>Traders will buy up protection by hedging with puts or speculate by buying more<br/>calls, in response to imminent events that bring a higher level of uncertainty<br/>(such  as company earnings releases, economic data reports, and political<br/>elections, among others). As a result, traders expect, at least for the short term,<br/>larger moves in stocks. As demand increases for the options on those stocks,<br/>their implied volatility generally increases, and options prices tend to rise. When<br/>those events pass or news comes out, the uncertainty dissipates, and implied<br/>volatility usually falls, along with option prices.</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">To find implied volatility of an option on Robinhood, follow these steps:</h2><ol id="l27"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Tap the Search icon at the bottom of your app</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Search for a stock symbol</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">In the Stock Information Page, tap Trade, then Trade Options</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Select the expiration at the top of the screen</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">Select the option from the chain you want to trade</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-left: 53pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">Under “Limit Price,” select the bid/ask and you’ll see this:</p></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Why does it matter?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span>If you’ve ever bought a call and watched the stock go up, only to watch your call<br/>go down in value, you’ve more than likely experienced a “volatility crush.” Think<br/>about volatility like a rubber band—when it’s stretched, it tends to be temporary,<br/>and at some point, snaps back.
