# Project-3_Wisdom_Learners
Catherine_Files
Our group Project 3 has decided to build a Streamlit Dashboard that explores Stock Options when to have Calls and Puts. 
My responsiblity in the project is to organize times we can meet and setup meetings. I also volunteered to create a chat bot in Streamlit. So far I have created code for chats via Streamlit-chat and Amazons AWS Lex. I expressed that having the Streamlit options pricing dashboard needs to be simple enough for the Stock Option retailer to grasp. I also wanted a link to learning material for Stock Options for the User to broaden their education on Stock Optains. 
I also have made a pdf from copy/paste differeent articles from Robinhood's platform for educational material on Stock Options. 
The article is a 167 page pdf that I compiled from Robinhood platform to help the user of the Options Pricing Dashbound to utilize in their learning with Optians.

I came up with code to be used as a chatbot for Streamlit but ran into errors with  Streatlit_app.py file
I found a few lines of code to create a hyperlink with in Steamlit application of the main Dashboard. my main issue is I need to create a URL for the pdf. I had not been able to do this in time for the  presentation.

I also maintain the GITHUB for our group along with creating a basic power point to be used in the presentation. 
I throughly enjoyed working with Todd and Richard in this project.
