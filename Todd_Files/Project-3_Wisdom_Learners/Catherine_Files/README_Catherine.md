# Project-3_Wisdom_Learners

Our group Project 3 has decided to build a Streamlit Dashboard that explores Stock Options when to have Calls and Puts. 
My responsiblity in the project is to organize times we can meet and setup meetings. I also volunteered to create a chat bot in Streamlit. So far I have created code for chats via Streamlit-chat and Amazons AWS Lex. I expressed that having the Streamlit dashboard needs to be simple enough for the Stock Option retailer to grasp. I also wanted a link to learning material for Stock Options for the User to broaden their education on Stock Optains. 
I also have made a pdf from copy/paste differeent articles from Robinhood's platform for educational material on Stock Options.
